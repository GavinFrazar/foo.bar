# foo.bar
Collection of my solutions to Google's foo.bar programming challenges.

If you are unfamiliar, Google's Foo.Bar challenges are a hidden prompt that appears semi-randomly when searching google for programming related concepts. There are 5 levels of increasing difficult challenges, with multiple challenges per level. Beat them all -> possibly get an interview with Google.

I am delaying completing the later levels of the challenge until I feel ready for a Google interview, should I actually manage to beat all of the levels that is :P.
